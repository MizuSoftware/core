# Core ðŸ§  [![CI][badge-ci]][ci] [![badge-mvnc]][project-mvnc]

[Mizu Client][mizu]'s *WIP* core monolithic repository. Uses [Kotlin], builds onto the [JVM].


## Modules

This repository is split into modules that serve a specific task by themselves. Everything you need to know
about them is described in their specific **README.md** files. Here are the modules, in the import stack order.

- [common] (needs nothing)

- [service-loader] (needs nothing)

- [configuration] (needs [common])

- [client-api] (needs [common], [configuration])


## Importing

You can import individual parts of the [Core][project-url] from [Maven Central][mvnc] by using the required module's
name as the artifact name, and `wtf.mizu.core` as the group by adding it to your dependencies block. As an example, we
will be importing all of the possible modules.

### Gradle

```kt
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("wtf.mizu.core:common:0.0.1")
    implementation("wtf.mizu.core:service-loader:0.0.1")
    implementation("wtf.mizu.core:configuration:0.0.1")
    implementation("wtf.mizu.core:client-api:0.0.1")
}
```

### Maven

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>wtf.mizu.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>common</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>wtf.mizu.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>service-loader</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>wtf.mizu.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>configuration</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>wtf.mizu.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>client-api</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```


## Libraries

In addition to those modules, we also use some external libraries.

- [Kawa][kawa] - An open-source, powerful and modular Kotlin-enhanced event bus for the JVM, designed by the Mizu team.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any kind of problem **related to this library**, you can [open an issue][new-issue] describing what's
up. We ask you to be as precise as you can, so that our developers can help you as fast as possible.

Non-project-related issues will most likely be closed without further ado.


## Contributing

You can contribute to this project by [forking it][fork], making your changes, and
[creating a new pull request][new-pr].

You have to be as precise as possible while doing it though, describing in the commits (or PR description) what you're
changing, why and how.
